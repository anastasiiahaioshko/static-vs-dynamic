    <h2>Static website:</h2>

    This <a href="https://www.antonastakhov.com">website</a> is a static. It is a portfolio of a web designer. All pages are created only by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though this website has great user interaction like the possibility to choose colors or turn on music, it was coded without the usage of databases, which makes it static. I like this website portfolio because if I were an employer it would be an excellent experience for me. This website developer created a choice of different colors for the website as well as added a button to turn on great music. Moreover, they showed their process of work, which helps potential employers to see how and how long it takes for their potential employee to create a project.

       <h2>Dynamic website: </h2>

      This <a href="https://megogo.net">website</a> is dynamic. This is a movie platform like Netflix which uses databases to collect information about movies, allow users to register, have a profile and personalized content, filter their search, see the top 5 movies or best by IMDB rating, etc. All of this makes this website dynamic. I like it because it is simple to use, as I mentioned before it always shows the top 5 movies and best movies by IMDB rating, which makes my experience as a user very smooth and convenient.Â
